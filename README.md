## branch go-runtime-caller-filename-autogenerated
This branch is a code example where `runtime.Caller` will return `<autogenerated>` as caller filename
instead of the actual file of the caller.

Requires using the main branch of Go (starting with this [commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/88cb17e1069bef854ead49c703262abdf93c9458), unreleased) to trigger (cannot reproduce with 1.20.x or 1.21.x).

```
go run main.go
```
